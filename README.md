##### This repository contains the Eddie compute cluster submission scripts used to process and integrate the raw SOX2, SOX9 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data for glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) cell lines and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines.

##### Many of the scripts have been adapted from those created by Alhafidz Hamdan for the analysis of SOX2/SOX9 ChIP-seq data. See https://github.com/alhafidzhamdan/SOX2_SOX9_self-renewal for these scripts.
